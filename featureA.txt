Good paragraphs begin with a topic sentence that briefly explains what the paragraph is about.
Next come a few sentences for development and support, elaborating on the topic with more detail.
Paragraphs end with a conclusion sentence that summarizes the topic or presents one final piece of support to wrap up.
